# travel-site

This is a single-page demo site, built using clean and organised HTML and CSS, modular and object-oriented JavaScript, and leverages build tools like Gulp and Webpack.

This page has been built with mobile-first and accessibility in mind, and makes use of features such as loading elements only when scrolled to, and lazyloading images for faster loading times.

You can view the finished site here: <a href="https://fisherc212.github.io/travel-site/">Live travel-site page</a>

## Contributing

Pull requests are the way to go here. I apologise in advance for the slow action on pull requests and issues. I only have two rules for submitting a pull request: match the naming convention (camelCase, categorised [fades, bounces, etc]) and let us see a demo of submitted animations in a pen. That last one is important.
