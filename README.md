# travel-site

This is a single-page demo site, built using clean and organised HTML and CSS, modular and object-oriented JavaScript, and leverages build tools like Gulp and Webpack.

This page has been built with mobile-first and accessibility in mind, and makes use of features such as loading elements only when scrolled to, and lazyloading images for faster loading times.
